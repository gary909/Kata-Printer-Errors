    <p>
        In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, <br>
        for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.<br>
        <br>
        The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would <br>
        be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h <br>
        then one time color a...<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced <br>
        e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.<br>
        <br>
        You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer <br>
        as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length <br>
        of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.<br>
        <br>
        The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.<br>
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        <br>
        s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"<br>
        printer_error(s) => "0/14"<br>
        <br>
        s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"<br>
        printer_error(s) => "8/22"<br>
